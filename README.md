# TheFalling


This is a project I'm working on to help me learn the python programming language, I'm essentially trying to make a game where each level represents 
an old popular arcade game, for example, in level one, the character is falling through the sky while enemies/projectiles spawn randomly, and it is the player's job to try
And avoid these enemies, the core mechanics of this level take inspiration from Space invaders. In level 2, the character plays in a 2D platform runner-type mode.
inspired by Mario and in the third level a mode inspired by flappy bird, then the fourth level goes back to the same game mode as level one, thus "The Falling".

I am going to try my best to write an incredible storyline for this project and implement my digital drawing as well as graphic design skills to build pleasant
looking visuals for the game, I haven't decided on the theme yet... once I learn how to do all the core mechanics and build the 3 basic level types I'll be able to build 
the storyline around that around m capabilities at the time.
